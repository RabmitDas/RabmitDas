👋 Hi there! I'm Rabmit Das

🎓 Biologist | Computational Systems Biologist | Bioinformatics Enthusiast

I’m passionate about combining biology, computation, and systems modeling to understand complex biological processes and develop data-driven solutions. My current focus lies in multi-omics integration, microbiome–metabolome interaction, and machine learning applications in biological research.

🧬 About Me

🔭 Currently exploring Neural Networks and their applications in biology — from molecular interaction prediction to microbiome-based disease diagnostics.

💡 Interested in Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), multi-omics data integration, and biological network algorithms.

🧠 Fascinated by how biological systems compute — aiming to bridge biological neural networks and artificial intelligence.

🧪 Background: Postgraduate in Biological Sciences (Major) and Computer Sciences (Minor) from NISER, with research experience in microbiome analysis, metagenomics, and systems biology.

📊 Skilled in Python, R, QIIME2, metabolic modeling, and machine learning pipelines for biological datasets.
